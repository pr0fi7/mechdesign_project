    "In assignment 1 we will analyze the motor that powers the transport chain. We will first determine the required speed, torque and power of the motor in order to determine the appropiate motor size. In the next step, we will estimate a function value K_A and discuss the efficiency of the system. **(From here until the end of the paragraph I'm not 100% sure that this is correct)** For this step, we will model the belt transmission and gear box as a single belt transmission since the detailed efficiency calculation (including the gearbox) will be determined in later assignments. Finally, we will analyze the junction key, and with the help of graphs, choose the correct conditions for the key.\n",

And since I'm not sure of how to properly determine this efficiency I just said let's assume 90%, but this is something we can modify once we figure out how to do it)**. With the required power into the motor, and the given rotational speed of its shaft, we can determine the input torque."

    "### Estimation and discussion on K_A and efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the application factor K_A, we first need to determine the drive, the startup conditions, the load conditions, the sensitivity and the daily use hours. Based on our setup, we have chosen the following values:\n",
    "- Drive: electromotor\n",
    "- Startup: light **(No idea of how to justify this, I tried to find some examples of what 'light', 'medium' or 'heavy' means, but I could not find any)**\n",
    "- Load: full load mild shocks **(Same as previous)**\n",
    "- Sensitivity: Friction wheel belts **(This is the reason why I said we model the whole thing as one belt, because otherwise I think we would need a K_A for the belt, and another for the gear box since one of the options is 'gear')**\n",
    "- Daily use: 20h\n",
    "\n",
    "- Application factor (K_A): 1.7\n",
    "\n",
    "The startup was chosen to be light since we could (and should) use a soft starter for the motor to reduce the mechanical stresses, also, the motor will have to start only about 5 times a week, which can be considered 'rare' for an asynchronous motor.  **(Here we could have also considered medium, I chose light assuming we can use a soft starter and also becuase chatGPT said that small asychronous motors can be started a few times per hour, so I guess our medim sized motor should be able to start a few times per week)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The load was chosen as full load with mild shocks becuase the load on the motor is high with respect to its limits, but more importantly, the whole system will suffer from shocks due to the coals being thrown inside the carts (the miners will most likely throw them in the carts carelessly)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sensitivity, as mentioned before, we are modelling our system as a single belt, however, when we design the full system with more detail, we will have to determine a separate K_A for the gearbox and for the transmission belt. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the daily use was set to 20h. The average daily use spread over the full year is lower since the motor only operates 250 per year, however, changing the average daily use from 20h to 14h would only change our application factor by less than 0.1, so we will stick to 20h. **(To me it seems strange to round to 20h but the guy said it doesn't matter so idk)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the function factor K_A is a crucial step to determine the efficiency of the system, however, to properly calculate the efficiency, we need to make some other design choices such as the belt ratio, the gear ratio, the diameter of the wheels for the belts, etc. **(In chapter 16, there's the formula that uses K_A to determine the 'calculation power', but I don't fully understan how it works, and it also uses the diameter of the wheels but to determine the diameter of the wheels we need to determine the ratios that we will use, and for that we already would need to consider the design of the gears since we would aslo need their diameters and ratios, but I don't think that we're supposed to already design that, so I'm a bit confused about the whole efficiency calculation)**"
